# Rank Up
Army list builder for the tabletop war game Kings of War

The goal of Rank Up is to be a army list builder for Kings of War that is comfortable and snappy to use, as well as give the ability to the user to make edits and entirely new entries to the data.

The first part will be an ongoing process throughout development in that aspects of the user interface will be reviewed and updated to be better.

The second part will be possible by using Rank Up Packages and the Rank Up Editor. RUPs contain not just entries of different units and stuff, but also updates and additions to data entries in other RUPs. The idea is that a package could contain data for errata or an expansion to the base army lists. A user can then choose to apply the package or not as they create their army list. Perhaps even a tournament organization can create a package that then conforms the data to their specifications, modifying points values or other stats.

## Getting it up and running

Rank Up can be obtained from a zip file on the [releases page](https://github.com/calvinjgs/rank-up/releases). Rank Up and Rank Up Editor are executable `.jar` files, which means if your computer runs Java, then you should be able to run Rank Up. On Windows, it should run by double-clicking on it. In a terminal the command is `java -jar "Rank Up.jar"` or `java -jar "Rank Up Editor.jar"` for the editor.

(This section should get updated on how to run .jar files on Linux and macOS some day.)

Some packages have already been made which can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1t30ptynw8njhyi/AACZnNyLSdL-TX_7xJ_qFk66a?dl=0) until a better place is found for them. `.rup` files are to be placed directly into the `packages` folder. This is the only place where Rank Up (and the Editor) will ever look for `.rup` files.
